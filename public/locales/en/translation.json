        "content": "Since its creation, the International Economic Actors Fair (SIAE) has established itself as an essential platform for meetings, reflection and collaboration between the driving forces of the Malagasy economy. During its first two editions — in 2022 and 2023 — Holiniaina Rakotomalala Norohariliva, founder of IKOLO, played a central role in the design, coordination and outreach of this major event, both nationally and internationally.\n\n🎯 **Strategic leadership serving openness**\nAs Director of External Relations of SIAE for both editions, Holiniaina orchestrated the institutional, diplomatic and sectoral links that allowed the fair to anchor itself in national and regional dynamics. Thanks to her keen sense of diplomacy and her ability to value local talents, she positioned SIAE as a convergence space between public, private and international actors.\n\n🧩 **Rigorous and inclusive coordination**\nIn parallel, she assumed the function of General Coordinator of the organization, ensuring logistical coherence, schedule fluidity and active partner involvement. Her inclusive approach mobilized a diversity of economic actors — entrepreneurs, institutions, cooperatives, donors — around a shared vision: that of a Malagasy economy rebuilt by its own forces.\n\n📣 **High-impact communication strategy**\nHoliniaina also supervised the fair's communication strategy, highlighting the values of innovation, collaboration and valorization of local initiatives. Through sensitive and strategic storytelling, she managed to radiate SIAE far beyond the fair's walls, in the media, social networks and influence circles.\n\n🤝 **An ambassador of economic networking**\nFinally, as organizer of B2B meetings, workshops and SIAE ambassador, she created bridges between entrepreneurs, investors and institutions. These meetings generated concrete opportunities for partnership, funding and growth for many project holders."

At the crossroads of biodiversity, research, entrepreneurship and sustainable development, this event brought together economic operators, institutions, donors and experts around a common ambition: to make Madagascar a regional leader in botanical innovation and responsible transformation.\n\n🤝 **Female coordination serving impact**\nAt the heart of this dynamic, Anna and Holy, two visionary entrepreneurs had the opportunity to carry the congress with rigor, creativity and commitment:\n\n• **Anna**, founder of Vina Consulting, ensured the overall coordination of the project, piloting the multi-channel communication strategy with institutional partners, PTF and economic operators. From logistical preparation to technical team mobilization, through webinar organization, supplier management and final report elaboration, she orchestrated each edition with remarkable precision.\n\n• **Holy Rakotomalala**, founder of IKOLO, being an expert in natural resource valorization, assumed the role of innovation manager and panelist manager. She designed thematic content, selected speakers, ensured panel monitoring-evaluation, and ensured that each speech contributed to a coherent and inspiring vision of natural innovation in Madagascar.\n\n🌱 **A congress serving transformation**\nThe two editions of the INIM Congress allowed:\n• To valorize local sectors: essential oils, plant extracts, cosmetic actives and nutraceuticals\n• To connect producers to international markets\n• To promote public-private partnerships to structure value chains\n• To raise awareness about traceability, quality and ethics in natural resource exploitation\n\nThrough a rich program of panels, workshops, exhibitions and B2B meetings, the congress laid the foundations for an innovation ecosystem rooted in Malagasy biodiversity and open to the world."

This workshop, under the sign of collaborative innovation, allowed participants to appropriate Design Thinking tools to design or improve their products in line with the real needs of their clients.\n\nFor **Holy Rakotomalala**, founder of IKOLO, this day had particular resonance. After more than a year of active consultancy within 2M Consulting, she contributed to the design and animation of several strategic workshops, including this one. This experience allowed her to strengthen her skills in facilitation, entrepreneurial support and innovation pathway structuring.\n\nThe workshop was also marked by the participation of **VINA**, represented by its founder **Anna**. This synergy between IKOLO and VINA perfectly illustrates the spirit of co-creation and entrepreneurial sisterhood that we defend: women leaders uniting to bring forth sustainable solutions adapted to local realities.\n\nIn continuation of this dynamic, IKOLO-VINA commits to promoting learning and collaboration spaces where women entrepreneurs can experiment, exchange and grow together."

This highlight brought together embassy representatives, the Ministry of Tourism and Crafts, associations, private actors and environmental defenders, all mobilized around the same ambition: to lay the foundations for more virtuous tourism in Madagascar.\n\nThis project, carried by the NGO Man and Environment Madagascar and coordinated by Label CBD Consulting, once again brought together the two committed entrepreneurs: **Anna**, Founder of Vina Consulting and **Holy Rakotomalala**, founder of IKOLO.\n\n🤝 **Female coordination serving a shared vision**\n\n**Anna** ensured the general co-coordination of the event with Label CBD, from logistics to communication, through team mobilization and supplier management. Her rigor and ability to federate allowed her to meet this challenge in record time.\n\n**Holy**, for her part, took charge of technical coordination, VIP guest reception management and press relations. Her attention to detail, federative energy and expertise in event management largely contributed to the fluidity and visibility of this day.\n\n🌱 **Ambalakalanoro: a jewel to preserve**\nThe Ambalakalanoro site, carried by the NGO Man and Environment, was at the heart of discussions. A true biodiversity gem, it embodies the potential of responsible tourism, rooted in nature and respectful of local communities. Kengo Kuma Day initiated a collective reflection on its development, in connection with the principles of sustainability, bioclimatic architecture and valorization of Malagasy natural heritage."
